I am a researcher specializing in Industrial AI, focusing on integrating physics-based simulations with data-driven models to advance system design and control. My work bridges first-principles modeling, such as thermodynamic simulations for power plants and robot kinematics, with modern neural architectures. I aim to develop efficient, trustworthy AI that operates under practical constraints like limited computation, data, and deployment environments.
