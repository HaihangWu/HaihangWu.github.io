I'm a researcher in deep learning and robotics. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Melbourne, advised by Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/2854-saman-halgamuge) and Prof. [Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo). Prior to that, I earned master's degrees in Energy and Robotics from Tsinghua University and the University of Bristol, respectively, and a bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering from Beihang University.
