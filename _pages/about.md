Dr. Yuan Sun completed his PhD in computer science and bachelorâ€™s in applied mathematics. He is a research fellow with the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, working towards Smarter & Faster Pharma with industrial partners such as CSL Limited. His current research focuses on developing effective machine learning models to enhance traditional optimization techniques such as column generation, Lagrangian relaxation, and (meta)heuristics. <br/>
