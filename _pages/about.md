My research focuses on deep learning and robotics. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne, where I was jointly supervised by Professors [Saman Halgamuge](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/2854-saman-halgamuge) and Prof [Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo). I also hold master’s degrees from Tsinghua University and the University of Bristol, as well as a bachelor’s degree in Automotive Engineering from Beihang University.
