__Motivation__: Tackling NP-hard problems typically requires specific algorithmic design with extensive domain knowledge. To alleviate human effort in this costly process, we aim to develop enhanced machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the optimal solution for combinatorial optimisation problems. The predicted solution is likely infeasible; however, it can be utilized to boost a search method.


__Gap__: Existing approaches are mainly _one-shot_, i.e., predicting the optimal solution only once, followed by repairing the predicted solution using a search method. Such _one-shot_ approaches are inadequate in dealing with the high complexity of NP-hard problems, particularly problems that are highly constrained and/or contain multiple optimal (or near-optimal) solutions. 


__Methodology__: We aim to develop an iterative framework that enables an ML model to make _multi-shot_ predictions. The high-level idea of our iterative framework is illustrated in the following figure, where an ML model predicts optimal solutions to guide a search method, which in turn provides feedback to refine the prediction of the ML model.

__Current progress__: We have instantiated this high-level idea by using a probabilistic sampling method and a simple ML model with statistical features computed from samples of solutions. The initial results are very promising, and we are currently exploring more in this direction.
